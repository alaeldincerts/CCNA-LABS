# CCNA-LABS
This repository contains a series of CCNA networking labs I’ve built and tested using EVE-NG. Each lab focuses on a key CCNA topic — from VLANs and Inter-VLAN Routing to Static &amp; Dynamic Routing, NAT, ACLs, and more.  

# 🧠 CCNA Labs

A collection of **hands-on networking labs** built and tested in **EVE-NG** — designed to help you practice, learn, and master core CCNA concepts.

---

This repository includes multiple CCNA-level labs covering:
- VLANs & Inter-VLAN Routing  
- Static and Dynamic Routing (RIP, OSPF, EIGRP)  
- NAT & PAT  
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)  
- DHCP, DNS, and basic network services  
- WAN concepts and trunking  

Each lab is based on **real-world scenarios** — simple enough for beginners, but detailed enough to help you build strong configuration and troubleshooting skills.

🧠 Why I Built This

I created these labs to sharpen my networking skills and help others who are also preparing for the CCNA certification.
Learning by doing has always been my favorite way to grow — and I hope these labs help you the same way they helped me.
